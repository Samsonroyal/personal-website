# I'm Jonathan Bakebwa. I live in Beijing, where I write software that runs on hundreds of thousands of devices.

After graduating from high school in 2014, I started my career in tech as a UI/UX designer at [A23 Labs](https://a23labs.com), where I designed UIs for various web and mobile apps. I also freelanced as a print designer for t-shirts, posters and book covers.

## 北京欢迎你 | Welcome to Beijing

In 2016, I moved to Beijing, China to purse my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Technology. During this time, I became proficient in Chinese because I had to study my course in Chinese. It was the challenge of language barrier that inspired me to join [Akkadu](https://akkadu.com) as a co-founding member, where we built software that empowered Remote Simultaneous Interpretation. With this software, the user could attend events, lectures and courses that are conducted in foreign languages.

## My Open Source Story
My first contribution to open-source was a documentation pull request to [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com) about extending it's webpack configuration. From there, I was inspired to share more of my work and research. As a front-end oriented engineer, I was inspired to build a component library that would allow consumers to author accessible user interfaces with an extendable theming API. This library later came to be known as [Chakra UI Vue](https://vue.chakra-ui.com), thanks to [Segun Adebayo](https://twitter.com/thesegunadebayo), who approached me and encouraged me to work on it.

## What I'm doing now
Right now, I lead a team of building open-source SDK and API service for Web 3 development at [Mirror World](https://mirrorworld.fun). I currently serve as CTO.

## Outside my work
I also serve and minister with [Manifest Fellowship](https://manifestfellowship.org/) on the IT department, as well as the regional head of Manifest APAC Region since.

I also play the guitar and write music, as well as read books on different topics.

## Things I'm passionate about

## Things I intend to do
