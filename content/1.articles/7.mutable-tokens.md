# Mutable NFTs - Why They Exist

_Published on 2022-03-22_
<br></br>

ðŸš¨ _This post is an [unpolished thought](https://twitter.com/siddharthkp/status/1246745962061746178?s=20)_

I recently spent some time investigating some NFTs that I owned and I realized that a significant percetage of NFTs that I own are mutable.

Mutable in this case refers to the quality of having metadata which is not stored on chain or on a permanent solution like [IPFS] . e.g. using a self-hosted DB/API. The host of the data can change the data returned by the `tokenUri`.

Shoutout to [rameerez.eth] for building looksmutable.com. I used his application to inspect a [mutable NFT that I own](https://looksmutable.com/nft/0x7592e2f251a7f7da27211625d652092769f43a60/10910).

A good percentage of Web 3 projects still use mutable endpoints to host their metadata.

Decentralized storage solutions currently cannot reflect the qualities of tokens that can be upgraded especially for [#GameFi] NFTs. e.g. a weapon NFT whose `level` can be upgraded.

Reflecting this kind of change in `level` would require the metadata to be mutable, thus required self-hosting metadata. This sadly goes against the grain of what a fully decentralized apps is about.

## Storing metadata on-chain
The other solution would be to store all this data on-chain

### Pros:
- Fully decentralized âœ…
- Relative state is store on-chain
- NFTs are still immutable

### Cons: 
- tokenUri may not reflect upgradable properties. (So popular wallets cannot consume such state deterministically).
- High gas fees on [ethereum] to update this kind of state.
- No presently defined protocol to standardize contract data across multiple chains. This work would be duplicated for each new chain one supports. e.g. [WormholeBridge] reflects metadata for Ethereum <-> Solana cross-chain transfers because each NFT's `tokenUri` is standardized by the [ERC721] standard on Ethereum and [Metaplex] Metadata standard on Solana.

## What solutions are being explored?

I believe that if [#GameFi] NFTs should have some relative mutable state, it should also be stored on-chain, at a low cost to allow for high-frequency reads & writes.

The desired result would be more NFTs would remain immutable.
